# Irrational Labs Setup

One-command setup for new team members. Installs your dev tools, sets up Claude Code, then asks which repositories you want to clone.

## Prerequisites

- A Mac or Windows PC
- A GitHub account added to the [IrrationalLabs-team](https://github.com/IrrationalLabs-team) org

## Install

### macOS

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaningJang/setup/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaningJang/setup/main/bootstrap.ps1 | iex
```

> Execution-policy error? Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` first.

## What it does

1. Installs base tools: Git, Git LFS, GitHub CLI, jq, Node (npm), Bun, Claude Code, and shell helpers (ripgrep, fd, bat, fzf, delta).
2. Signs you in to GitHub and sets your commit identity.
3. Installs the [`gws` Google Workspace CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@googleworkspace/cli) (run `/gws:setup` in Claude Code afterward to sign in). IL Claude Code plugins are no longer registered here — the IL claude.ai org pushes them automatically once you sign in to Claude Code.
4. **Asks which repositories to clone** — the menu only shows repos your GitHub account can access.
5. For **Irrational Labs HQ**, runs its full setup (media tools, Git LFS, dependencies, secrets). Other repos get a generic best-effort setup (dependencies, LFS, `.env` scaffold).

## Uninstall / offboarding

To reverse what setup added (e.g. when a consultant leaves), run:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaningJang/setup/main/uninstall.sh | bash

Windows (PowerShell):

    irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaningJang/setup/main/uninstall.ps1 | iex

It reads a receipt the installer wrote (`~/.config/il-setup/receipt.json`) and
presents a menu:

1. **Recommended** — remove the IL footprint & access: cloned repos, `gws` CLI +
   Google credentials, IL Claude plugins, GitHub login, git identity, PATH edits.
2. **Everything the script installed** — preset 1 plus Claude Code, the dev tools
   the script installed, and Bun.
3. **Custom** — pick categories one by one.

It only removes tools the script itself installed (never ones that predated it),
restores your previous git identity, and edits only the IL keys in
`settings.json` — it never deletes `~/.claude`. Removing Homebrew entirely is
available only via the custom picker, with a warning.

## Just the tools, or a specific repo

Skip the menu with flags:

```bash
# macOS — base tools only, clone nothing
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL .../bootstrap.sh)" _ --base-only

# macOS — clone specific repos by key
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL .../bootstrap.sh)" _ --repos hq,marketing
```

```powershell
# Windows
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm .../bootstrap.ps1))) -BaseOnly
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm .../bootstrap.ps1))) -Repos hq,marketing
```

Repo keys come from [`repos.json`](repos.json).

## Re-run anytime

Both scripts are idempotent — re-running skips what's installed, repairs what's broken, and re-shows the menu so you can add another repo later.

## Add a repo to the menu

Edit [`repos.json`](repos.json): add an entry with a `key`, `slug`, `dir`, and `setup` (`"hq"` or `"generic"`). Both platforms pick it up automatically.
